Context
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository is a catch all for analyses and miniatures that are too small to require a dedicated project. For example, someone somewhere just *needs* this one plot for this one place this one time. You want a whole repo for that ? Probably not. But can it get its own baby project folder here ? Yeah sure why not.
